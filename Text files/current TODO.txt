Prioritized:


1. Eliminate the self-kill twice bug
2. Q3dm4 deform vertices shader bug
3. Eliminate the animation getting stuck bug
4. Death indication
5. Add cling sound on clients
6. Send game score mode and parameters to clients
-- f.e. time_limit and time left
-- game end should NOT be triggered by clients, it should be triggered from server


* Better shooting animation
* Better death animation (hopefully ragdolls)



---==== BUGS ====---

* Client can't shoot at some point !!! add text message or something like that when out of ammo for debugging
--- It's a bug in the AnimationController - an animation is stuck of 1.f and doesn't fade out
--- Perhaps it's related to loopable <- happened also on not loopable.

* Falling into death many times causes a double death on client
--- Perhaps it's because client+master triggers death?

* If two players have the same name on networked game everything goes wild ? (not sure that's true anymore)

* Projectiles pass through portals on server but client doesn't see that - perhaps there's need for that message

* After client is connected, Escape doesn't disconnect + bring him back to the main menu

* GUI Bug - doesn't aim well on lower resolutions (seen on windowed)

* Crash on exit

 ---=== NETWORKING ===---

* Disconnection should be handled correctly and information should be presented to the user 
--- On both server<->client, client<->client

* Version
--- Show version
--- Validate that clients have the same version as server

---=== GAMEPLAY ===---

* Message - Victory!
----- Stop game and maybe fly through all spawn points or allow fly through while showing score board
----- Use the downloaded winning mp3s =)

* On client: Remember previously used server IP
* Show indication of death
----- Start with sound
----- some visual indication
----- eventually ragdoll

* Add a queue of game messages, so they won't be at the same time


* Collectables
---- Relveant shape (Life/Mana)
---- Different sound

* Provide a choose character screen for both server/client
* Provide an ingame choose map screen for the server

* Game Modes:
---- Frag Limit - Add 3/2/1 frags left

* Server should decide map (and client should report if he doesn't have the map) - add options box (
*** At first left/right arrow move between the options, after that also two arrow buttons

* Windowed Mode - click on window restores exclusive focus, escape remove control
* Alt-Tab

* Choose default server IP on the game setting menu

* Double-Death
* Aim should focus on the ray-intersetion location at the point of trigger (Especially for mancubus)
* Fix the shooting:
--- Make sure that only the latest attack animation triggers work
* Shoot should start immidiately and from the center of the screen (?)


* Add Hebrew Text/Fonts - Stuff like "[winning_player_name] Totach!" and "[worst_score_player] - Yatsata Tuna!"

* zlib - read the pk3 - File manager should always look first in actual directory and then in the pk3 (to allow overriding)

---=== PHYSICS ===---

* Add collision brushes to bezier patches
* FIX in collision detection and response:
--- jumping into corners
--- stair climbing gives too much strength up

---=== GRAPHICS ===---

* In the case of Q3A shader scripts with the first pass being opaque, use PPL for that first pass
* Add usage of static baked lightmap 
* Consider the scripts sort value
* Vertex Deformation
* Profile and improve performance !!!!

* Animation:

make more generic 
    * It's weird right now that you both need a fixed order and provide an animation type keyword
    * perhaps allow animations priorities to be inserted in the chr file.

* Seems like shader scripts for the center jump-pads at q3dm17 is missing some rgbgen functionality
	
* FIX shadows (shadows dissapear at some distance)

* add scissor testing of depth as well !

* add sun light

* add specular blooming

* remove rendering of renderables that aren't usefull like sky (and are time consuming...)

* Fix PPL - there's a line in the middle of models that is messed up

* change from the GetForceReBind() method inside texture into a method that also doesn't rebind in case of proxy RTTs.

* perhaps make RTTs more flexible, and allow game coder to use "$Camera Whatever" as map
  (that way he can choose a special reso for it)

*  clean all the matrix code, now that i have same matrices for gl and d3d,
i can stop having transpose stuff...

* store ALL options of autouniforms inside the GraphicsAPI

* notice when material sends autouniform that the shader doesn't need
    OR when the shader needs something and the material doesn't provide it

* add text to gl

* add some feature to shaders, in order to only update parameters instead of rebinding the entire program

---=== Done ===---

*===Gameplay===* Implemented collision against bezier patches
*===Networking===* Implemented udp punch-a-hole - server and client use the same port. This way only Server needs to use port forwarding
*===Bugs===* Solved the broken local gameplay problem
*===Gameplay===* Drastically lowered self damage
*===GUI===* Much better chat
*===Gameplay===* Added late client join into session
*===Graphics===* Added a sin up/down movement for collectables
*===Graphics===* Added centering of static loaded objects
*===Bugs===* Removed the "Direct Hit" message when hit player is dying
*===Networking===* Clients receieve server chosen map correctly
*===Gameplay===* Increased the height of the player camera
*===Gameplay===* added Time Limit game play mode
*===Gameplay===* decreased collectable size and projectiles now don't explode on it
*===Bugs===* added InitWeights of AnimationController - should hopefully solve the animation stuck problem (which prevents shooting)
*===Graphics===* Combined Q3A shader scripts with my PPL code for textures that aren't scripts (plain images)
*===Gameplay===* Added GamePlay messages 
*===Gameplay===* --- Taken/Lost the lead
*===Gameplay===* --- Remaining time (5/1 minute(s) left)
*===Gameplay===* --- If match end time reached, and there's no unique winner there's a message "You are tied for the lead" and game ends with the first unique winner
*===Gameplay===* Added out of body experience - pressing F9 makes you leave your body and fly around as a ghost (while leaving your physical body volurnable)
